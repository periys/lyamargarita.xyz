Welcome to the Margaritaville SMP information page!

## How do I get access to the server?
- You need to be a subscriber to lyamargarita on Twitch
  - "_Booooo! Why?!_" I hear you shout. But it's not what you think! Margaritaville is a small close-knit community and our subscribers are some of our most active members. We ask this of you so we can be more certain you won't grief or misbehave.
- Let us know in the Discord that you'd like access by posting in the #sub-channel, periys or Lya will whitelist you.

## What do I need to get?
Now that you've got access, let's get you set up. You'll need the following things to get started:
- A Minecraft account (note: this server is **Java only**
- The [Modrinth launcher](https://modrinth.com/app)
  - Whilst it is _technically_ possible to use another launcher, no support will be provided to you if you choose to do this. Sorry!
- A semi-decent PC
  - We're not talking next-level supercomputer, but you'll need something with at least 16GB RAM, a newish processor and ideally a modern graphics card to get the best experience.
- [Download the modpack](https://mega.nz/file/7coHRSYZ#x64e5yvNc-L6B_t7XfbQE9-HaCaltvpAuAo2J6hhXxU)

## How do I set it up and connect?
- Install Modrinth
- Log in to your Minecraft Microsoft account in the Modrinth launcher

- Adjust the `Java memory` field to something reasonable, ideally more than 4096MB as a minimum - anything above 6114MB will be fine
  - You will need to check the box `Override global memory settings`
  - ⚠️ If you only have 8GB of RAM total, allocating half of it (4096MB) is not advisable, your mileage may vary

- That's it! Press play!
